    "description": "Hello world, I return with my first animation of the new year! I've been inspired by the 3D pens on here lately, I figured why not give it a shot! What I had originally planned to draw for practice proliferated into this animation. It was fun to try new techniques, including mixins for building 3D shapes, and box shadows to enhance details. I hope you all are having a wonderful new year.\n\nInspiration: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bq2DKclA7JB/",
